  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">I 3D modeled and 3D printed a scaled-down version of the elementary school I went to, Merryhill Elementary. I made this for fun as a 'last memory' of elementary school before graduating. This took me about 10 hours to model in Blender using a variety of techniques, some of which I learned along the way. I used Google Earth 3D satellite maps and images of the exterior of the buildings as points of reference. </p>
